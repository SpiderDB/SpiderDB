## SpiderDB
Welcome to SpiderDB, a NoSQL document store with query and rollback features. It utilizes the type safety of TypeScript with the power and simplicity of Node.js to create a developer-friendly, extensible NoSQL platform. 

*SpiderDB was made in fullfillment of the requirements for CS 609 - Database Management in the fall of 2016.*
