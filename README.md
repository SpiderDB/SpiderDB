## SpiderDB
Welcome to SpiderDB, a NoSQL document store with query and rollback features. It utilizes the type safety of TypeScript with the power and simplicity of Node.js to create a developer-friendly, extensible NoSQL platform. 

*SpiderDB was made in fullfillment of the requirements for CS 609 - Database Management in the fall of 2016.*

##Installation
###Binary Executable
Node.js binaries are available in the releases section. They depend on the Node.js runtime using the command
```js
$node spiderDB.js
```
Click [here](https://github.com/SpiderDB/SpiderDB/releases) for download!

###Build from source
You can also build SpiderDB from source. Below is a platform-specific way of getting SpiderDB up an running.

####Linux
To install onLinux, execute the following commands in the terminal inside of the directory you wish to save SpiderDB
```
    $sudo apt-get install nodejs
    $sudo apt-get install npm 
    $npm install -g typescript
    $git clone https://github.com/SpiderDB/SpiderDB.git 
    $tsd install require --save
```

####Mac
 First, download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) then run the following terminal commands
 ```
$npm install npm --global
$npm install -g typescript
$git clone https://github.com/SpiderDB/SpiderDB.git 
$ npm install
$tsc
```
 Navigate to the now created "compiled" folder inside of the SpiderDB root directory and run the following command to start SpiderDB
```
$node spiderDB.js
```

####Windows
 First, download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Next, download the spider DB master branch files above and save them to the directory you wish to use SpiderDB. Open a Windows command prompt, navigating to the SpiderDB directory, and run the following commands
 ```
 > npm install -g typescript
 > npm install
 > tsc
 ```
 Navigate to the now created "compiled" folder inside of the SpiderDB root directory and run the following command to start SpiderDB
```
> node spiderDB.js
```

##Getting started

###Basic Command Line Instructions
You can interact with SpiderDB using a command line interface (CLI). Below are a basic list of instructions:
* ```-v``` - Display the current version number of SpiderDB
* ```-h``` - List all available instructions
* ```-r``` - Initiate a rollback of the last statement
* ```-q <#parameter#>``` - Initiate a database query or management statement

###Collection Management
SpiderDB comes with a complete instruction set to manage collections (databases). All database queries are initiated by the use of the ```-q <#statement#>``` structure in the SpiderDB command line interface (CLI). The parameter is structured as simple javascript. The instuctions are listed below using a database called "name":

* ```-q db.createCollection("name")``` - Creates a collection called "name"
* ```-q db.retrieveCollection("name")``` - Retreieves the full collection "name"
* ```-q db.listCollections()``` - Lists all collections by name in the current instance of SpiderDB
* ```-q db.deleteCollection("name")``` - Deletes the collection "name"
* ```-q db.clear()``` - Removes all databases

####Document Management
Documents are also managed using the ```-q <#statement#>``` structure. Below is a list of operations for managing documents inside of a collection:

#####Insertion
```js 
-q db.using("name").insert({ cwid: 1234, count: 1 })
```

#####Information Retrieval
Information retrieval is accomplished using the ```find()``` function. The following finds a document set where all documents's cwid fields are equal to 1234 and returns the sum the count field.
```js
-q db.using("name").find().where(x => x.cwid === 1234).sum("count")
```

This query returns a number with the average of the count parameter of all tables
```js
-q db.using("name").find().avg("count")
```

#####Update
```js
-q db.using("name").update({ cwid: 12345, count: 1 }).where({ field: "cwid", operator: "==", value: 1234 })
```

#####Removal
```js
-q db.using("name").delete().where({ field: "cwid", operator: "==", value: 12345 })
```

####Aggregates
Available aggregate functions are
* avg
* sum
* count
* min
* max

###Constraint Management
Currently supported are the "must be unique" and "must exist" constraint. Below are the creation and management of two such constaints on the "name" collection

####Constraint creation
Creates a constraint named c1 that requires the cwid field be unique
```js 
-q db.using("name").createConstraint({ name: "c1", field: "cwid", type: "unique"})
```
Creates constraint named c2 that requires document insertions containt the count field
```js
-q db.using("name").createConstraint({ name: "c2", field: "count", type: "exists"})
```

###Other operations
Lists all constaints in the "name" collection
```js
-q db.using("name").listConstraints()
```
Returns the details of constraint c2
```js
-q db.using("name").retrieveConstraint("c2")
```
Removes constraint c2 from the "name" collection
```js
-q db.using("name").deleteConstraint("c2")
```
